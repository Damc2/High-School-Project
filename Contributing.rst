Contributions
------------------

We follow typical `GitHub flow
<https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_.

1. `Fork this repository <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_ into your personal space. 
2. Start a new topical branch for any contribution. Name it sensibly,
   e.g. ``fixed-code-errors``.
3. Test your branch on a local site. If everything works as expected,
   please sign your commits to indicate its quality.
4. Create logically separate commits for logically separate things.
5. Please add any ``(closes #123)`` directives in your commit log
   message if your pull request closes an open issue.
6. Issue a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/>`_. 
   If the branch is not quite ready yet, please indicate ``WIP`` (=work in progress) in the pull request title.

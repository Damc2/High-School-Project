    "This tutorial includes information about starting the usage of Jupyter Notebook. In addition to these basics Jupyter offers lots of different possibilities for example for calculations, data-analysis, teaching or learning of programming. A good way to learn the usage of Jupyter or programming is to challenge oneself. _What will this piece of code do? How could I write a notebook that would calculate an average of grades? Could it be possible to do a histogram from the grades?_\n",
